Eat good food, work on a project (or bring your own), find a mentor or be a mentor, and network with leading programming experts, recruiters, and entrepreneurs in San Antonio, Texas.</p>
                            <p>We'll spend about six hours together. We'll have a speaker, eat some food, and then spend time networking and working on software projects. You can bring something you're already working on or start one of the easy projects we provide materials on.</p>

                        <dd class="left">Absolutely! Our projects are beginner-friendly. We’ll also post the project and some recommended reading beforehand, if you want to print it out ahead of time.</dd>

                        <dt class="right">“Does Dinner and Code cost anything?”</dt>
                        <dd class="right">Nope. Dinner and Code is free for everyone to attend. We believe that everyone who wants to learn to code should be able to in a safe environment. </dd>

                        <dt class="left">“What languages do you teach?”</dt>
                        <dd class="left">Right now we’re focusing on easier languages to learn, such as Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. However, our mentors know many languages so if you need help with a speciﬁc project you’ll likely ﬁnd someone who can help.</dd>

                        <dt class="right">“What are the age limits for Dinner and Code?”</dt>
                        <dd class="right">Due to the time of the event, everyone under 18 should attend with a legal guardian. Otherwise… we don’t discriminate.</dd>

                        <dt class="left">“I don’t have my own laptop. Can I still come?”</dt>
                        <dd class="left">Absolutely! Please reach out to us ahead of time so we can reserve a laptop for your use.</dd>

                            <p>Sure, especially if you plan on hiring Dinner and Code attendees. Remember that this includes individuals who may not have a degree in Computer Software or years of experience but who will have a lot of drive to succeed.</p>
